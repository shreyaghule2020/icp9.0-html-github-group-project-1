        <p>The Tata Altroz is a subcompact car/supermini
          manufactured by Tata Motors. The Altroz was revealed 
          at the 89th Geneva International Motor Show alongside 
          new Buzzard, Buzzard Sport, and H2X compact SUV concept.
          It was launched to the Indian market on 22 January 2020. 
          The name "Altroz" was inspired by the name of bird species, 
          Albatross.[citation needed]At present, the Altroz has 
          three engines on offer, which are 1.2-litre three-cylinder 
          petrol, 1.5-litre turbodiesel and a 1.2-litre three-cylinder 
          turbocharged petrol.There is a 5-speed manual transmission 
          on offer, with an optional wet-clutch DCT automatic known as Altroz

        <p>The Suzuki Brezza (known as Vitara Brezza for the first 
            generation) is a subcompact crossover SUV from Suzuki and 
            manufactured by Maruti Suzuki in India. The Brezza is the 
            first Suzuki-branded car which was fully developed in India.
            The model was designed as a smaller alternative to the global 
            market Vitara and targeted to young audiences. It is only available 
            for right-hand drive emerging markets in Asia and Africa.
            The first-generation model was also marketed by Toyota as the 
            Toyota Urban Cruiser between 2020 and 2022.
            As in the original Vitara model, the name "Vitara" 
            is derived from English word "vital," as in "vitality,"
            while the name "Brezza" means "breeze" in Italian.

          <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class, colloquially known as the 
            G-Wagen[3] (as an abbreviation of Geländewagen) is a 
            four-wheel drive automobile manufactured by Magna Steyr 
            (formerly Steyr-Daimler-Puch) in Austria and sold by 
            Mercedes-Benz. Originally developed as a military off-roader, 
            later more luxurious models were added to the line. In certain 
            markets, it was sold under the Puch name as Puch G until 2000.
            The G-Wagen is characterised by its boxy styling and 
            body-on-frame construction. It uses three fully locking 
            differentials, one of the few passenger car vehicles to 
            have such a feature.</p>

            1973 in Belgium (French: Société Coopérative) and owned by the 
            banks and other member firms that use its service. SWIFT provides 
            the main messaging network through which international payments 
            are initiated.[2] It also sells software and services to financial
             institutions, mostly for use on its proprietary "SWIFTNet", and

        <p>The first-generation Safari was presented in 1998 in 
            India. The Tata range in the nineties saw the expansion 
            into new markets with newer models such as the Indica 
            city car and the Safari. Exports to Europe took place 
            during the same year, with sales in the UK in 1999.
            The Safari is powered by the same engine used in the 
            Tata Telcoline, a 2.0-litre Peugeot XD88 turbodiesel unit 
            with 87 PS (64 kW) power. It came with a synchromesh

        <p>Named after the Thar Desert, the Mahindra Thar was 
            first introduced in 2010 as a modernized version 
            of the Mahindra Legend, which was based on the Mahindra 
            MM540, a vehicle that was in production in India since the 
            1980s.The Thar was designed to be a rugged, reliable, 
            and affordable off-road vehicle that could handle the 
            rough terrain found in many parts of India. Its design 
            is based on the iconic Jeep CJ series, which Mahindra had 
            been producing under license since the 1940s.
            The first generation Mahindra Thar was powered by a 
            2.5-liter turbocharged diesel engine that produced 105 
            horsepower and 247 Nm of torque. The vehicle was available 
            in two trim levels: the DI 2WD and the DI 4WD. The DI 2WD 
            was a basic version that came with a soft top and no air 
            conditioning, while the DI 4WD came with air conditioning 
            and a hardtop. In 2015, Mahindra introduced an updated 
            version of the Thar called the Thar CRDe.</p>
